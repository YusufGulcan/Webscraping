# Webscraping
Scraping Data from a retail e-commerce web store.
The code is created on 06/16/2022. Involves webscraping methods. Therefore, it might be subject to anti-scripting activities if used excessively in a small time period.
The code is wrapped by a function called Trendyoldata(input), where 'input' is an integer that defines the number of pages the user wants to crawl. 
I am open to any kind of improvement suggestions. Thank you.
